# dwm: Dynamic Window Manager

Welcome to my personal build of dwm. dwm is an incredible lightweight and fast tiling window manager for X developed by the [suckless](https://suckless.org/) community. The window manager is written in C and also requires the enduser to modify the code if changes are desired. Luckily there are a lot of patches written by dwm/suckless users for those that are less familiar with C.

## Patches

- [fullgaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fullgaps/dwm-fullgaps-20200508-7b77734.diff). Enable gaps between windows.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/sinanmohd/dwm
```

```

```

If you are using xinitrc. add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx
